##Augmenting the sounds around you
###Put your earplugs, walk around and experiment a slightly distorted reality ðŸ™‰


This is a small experiment I wanted to build after playing around with the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inception-the-app/id405235483?mt=8" target="_blank">Inception app</a>. This is the same idea but using web technologies and you can control the effects. It also works offline ðŸ˜€</p>
This site was build using <a href="https://alemangui.github.io/pizzicato/" target="_blank">PizzicatoJS</a> and <a href="https://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/examples/gui/#1--Basic-Usage" target="_blank">dat.GUI</a>.</p>
